### **Week 1 – Networking Fundamentals**

# 🗂️ Week 1 — Virtualization & Basic Networking Lab
This week focused on building the foundation of my Network+ home lab using multiple hypervisors (Hyper-V and VMware Workstation Pro) and verifying VM-to-VM connectivity across the same network.  

---

## 🔧 Lab Objectives
- Build a multi-hypervisor virtual environment  
- Install Ubuntu Desktop (VMware + Hyper-V)  
- Install Ubuntu Server (VMware)  
- Connect all VMs to the same network  
- Verify communication using `ip a` and `ping`  
- Document results with screenshots  

---

## 🖥️ Virtual Machines Used
| VM Name | Hypervisor | OS | Purpose |
|--------|------------|----|---------|
| `ubuntu-desktop-vmware` | VMware Workstation | Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 | Client workstation |
| `ubuntu-desktop-hyperv` | Hyper-V | Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 | Second workstation |
| `ubuntu-server` | VMware Workstation | Ubuntu Server 22.04 | Server for future labs |

## 🌐 Network Topology (Week 1)

[ VMware Ubuntu Desktop ]
→ Same subnet → Full connectivity
[ Hyper-V Ubuntu Desktop ] /
|
[ Ubuntu Server (VMware) ] — Added to same network, reachable by both desktops


All VMs were placed on the same broadcast domain using bridged networking + ZeroTier where needed.
